# Absence Assistant: Employee Leave Request Management System

SoDak EduTech, Agentic AI Track, Day 4. Weekend project: a complete agent service for managing
employee leave requests with multi-agent architecture, durable execution, and idempotency.

An employee asks a question in plain English. A **supervisor** agent delegates to two **specialist**
agents: an info specialist that can only look, and a desk specialist that can apply/withdraw leave
and send manager notifications. The run is a job on a queue, and a worker that dies halfway through
doesn't apply leave twice.

```
employee ─▶ queue (agent.db) ─▶ worker ─▶ supervisor ──ask_info──▶ info agent ─▶ get_leave_balance, list_holidays
                                                     └─ask_desk──▶ desk agent ──▶ get_employee, check_can_apply,
                                                                                   apply_leave*, withdraw_leave*, notify_manager*
                                                                        * side effects: run once per key
```

## Domain: Leave Request Management

**Features:**
- Display leave balance (annual, sick, casual)
- Display holiday calendar
- Apply for leave
- Withdraw applied leave
- Notify manager

**Critical constraint**: Leave balance can never go negative (enforced by business rule in data)

## Run it (no API key needed)

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate     # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m scripts.demo            # two questions, scripted models, every step printed
python -m scripts.demo --crash    # the worker dies right after applying; a second worker finishes: PASS
pytest                            # 15+ tests, under a second
```

With Gemini (`export GEMINI_API_KEY=...`):

```bash
python -m scripts.demo --real                                      # same questions, real models
python -m scripts.worker                                           # terminal 1
python -m scripts.ask --employee E001 "What's my leave balance?"  # terminal 2
```

One question costs about 5–7 model calls with three agents, so the free tier runs out quickly.
Use the scripted models for everything except a final check.

## Where each day shows up

| Day | Idea | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The agent loop, self-healing tool errors | `app/agents.py` `run_specialist` |
| 2 | Tool descriptions are prompts; rules live in data; schema | `app/tools/leave_tools.py`, `schema/leave.sql` (`policy` table) |
| 2 | Agent memory apart from business data | `agent.db` vs `leave.db` |
| 3 | A run is a job: queue, lease, heartbeat, reaper | `app/memory.py`, `app/worker.py`, `app/runner.py` |
| 3 | Idempotency keys; safe writes | `LeaveDb.once`, `LeaveDb.apply_leave`, `record_notification` |
| 4 | Supervisor and specialists ("agent as tool") | `app/agents.py` `SupervisorTools` |
| 4 | Least privilege per agent | info has no write tools; `DeskTools` is bound to one employee_id |
| 4 | Keys passed down to specialists | `run_tool` hands the delegation's key to `run_specialist` |

## Seed data

| Employee | Annual | Sick | Casual | What happens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E001 Priya Raman | 15 days | 10 days | 5 days | Can apply |
| E002 Arjun Kumar | 0 days | 12 days | 3 days | Refused: insufficient annual leave |
| E003 Divya Sekar | 20 days | 10 days | 5 days | Has 1 pending leave |

Holidays: Republic Day (2026-01-26), Holi, Independence Day, Gandhi Jayanti, Christmas.

Policies: `min_notice_days = 3`, `max_continuous_days = 30` (enforced by business rules in data, not in prompts).

## Architecture

**Two databases:**
- `agent.db`: Thread history, run queue, steps (reusable framework)
- `leave.db`: Employees, leave requests, holidays, notifications (domain-specific)

**Three agents:**
- **Supervisor**: Delegates to specialists, never checks balances or applies leave itself
- **Info Agent**: Read-only specialist (get_leave_balance, list_holidays)
- **Desk Agent**: Write specialist bound to ONE employee (apply_leave, withdraw_leave, notify_manager)

**Idempotency:**
- Every side effect runs through `LeaveDb.once()` with SHA256 key = hash(run_id, step_seq, tool_name, args)
- Keys stored atomically with effects in `idempotency` table
- Safe-to-repeat operations handle duplicates gracefully (e.g., `apply_leave` checks for existing request)

**Durable execution:**
- Every step recorded before proceeding
- Crash recovery via `rebuild()` - reconstructs state from database
- Worker lease expiry triggers requeue
- Max 3 attempts before dead-lettering

## Known limits (on purpose, for later days)

- A specialist's inner steps are not stored; only the delegation and its answer are. After a crash the
  specialist runs again, and keys keep its side effects single. Storing them is checkpointing (Day 5).
- Keys only match if the model repeats the same call. The scripted models always do; real models
  usually do at temperature 0. The leave application and notification are also safe to repeat on their own.
- No approval step before a side effect (Day 5), no guardrails or metrics (Day 6), no MCP (Day 7).

## Design decisions

1. **Leave balance as constraint**: The `check_can_apply` tool reads from the employee's current balance
   and policy table, enforcing the "balance never negative" rule even if the model skips the check.

2. **Optimistic locking**: Leave requests use unique constraint on (employee_id, start_date, end_date, 
   leave_type) to prevent duplicate applications in race conditions.

3. **Least privilege**: Info agent has ZERO write tools; desk agent is bound to ONE employee_id at
   construction time, so the model cannot apply leave for someone else.

4. **Business rules in data**: Policy table stores `min_notice_days` and `max_continuous_days` as rows,
   not hardcoded in prompts. Tools read from this table, making rules auditable and changeable.

5. **Safe-to-repeat operations**: `apply_leave` checks for existing request and returns `already_applied`;
   `withdraw_leave` checks status and returns `already_withdrawn`; `record_notification` uses dedupe key.

## What was implemented

✅ Two SQLite databases (agent.db, leave.db) with seed data  
✅ Five tools: 2 read-only (info agent), 3 side effects (desk agent)  
✅ Business rule in data (`policy` table enforced by `check_can_apply`)  
✅ Queue with worker, lease, heartbeat, reaper  
✅ Idempotency keys for all side effects  
✅ Multi-agent: supervisor + 2 specialists, info agent has no write tools  
✅ Works without API key: scripted models, crash demo (PASS), pytest with 15+ tests  
✅ Crash-and-replay test validates idempotency  

## Testing

```bash
pytest -v                           # All tests with verbose output
pytest tests/test_tools.py          # Tool unit tests only
pytest tests/test_end_to_end.py -k crash  # Crash replay test only
python -m scripts.demo --crash      # Visual crash demo
```

All tests pass without an API key using scripted models.

## Next steps (not implemented)

- Retry with exponential backoff (lab 2)
- Cancel from second terminal (lab 1) 
- Race condition test with threads
- Successful run on real Gemini (requires API key)
- Date validation (ensure leave dates are in future, not on holidays)
- Approval workflow (manager approval before finalizing leave)
